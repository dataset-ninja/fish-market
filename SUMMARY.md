**Fish Market Dataset** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 16859 images with 16919 labeled objects belonging to 19 different classes including *rui*, *taki*, *aair*, and other: *mrigel*, *pabda*, *katla*, *boal*, *puti*, *shol*, *ilish*, *tara baim*, *kal baush*, *pangas*, *koi*, *magur*, *foli*, *deshi puti*, *chapila*, and *telapiya*.

Each image in the Fish Market dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 186 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (1279 images), *valid* (3106 images), and *train* (12474 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://www.rf100.org/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/).
